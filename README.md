# Gaussian2line

This is to record thought process on project n-dimentional Gaussian to a line.

My problems exposed includes: inference ability on linear algebra is close to zero. I don't know how to use vector operators.

For my projection code, I use the above inference results. There are still a few question unclear. 

(1) projection line:  I can understand that if a projection line starts from zero as in following line v1, but what if a different line that does not pass zeros like v2?
